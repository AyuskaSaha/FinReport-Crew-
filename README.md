üí∞ Financial Insight Generator
‚ú® Overview
This project implements a lightweight yet powerful financial analysis application using a CrewAI multi-agent system. It leverages two specialized AI agents to handle the end-to-end process of financial report generation:

The Data Analyzer

The Report Generator

The application is hosted via a Streamlit interface, providing a user-friendly way to input a stock ticker and instantly receive a comprehensive financial analysis report.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup
This guide will get your multi-agent system running locally using a Python virtual environment.

Prerequisites
Python 3.9+ is required.

An API Key for the Large Language Model (LLM) you are using (OpenAI).

Step-by-Step Guide
Clone the Repository: Open your terminal (PowerShell) and clone the project:



git clone https://github.com/AyuskaSaha/FinReport-Crew-.git

Create a Virtual Environment (venv): It's best practice to create an isolated environment to manage dependencies:

Bash

python -m venv venv
Activate the Environment: Activate the environment. Your terminal prompt should show (venv) once successful:

Bash

.\venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies: Install all required packages (CrewAI, Streamlit, etc.) from the requirements.txt file:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment Variables: Create a file named .env in the root directory and add your API key. This file is ignored by Git for security:

# Example for OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

üèÉ Usage: Running the Application
Once the setup is complete, you are ready to launch the Streamlit interface and generate your first financial report.

Ensure the Virtual Environment is Active: Verify you see (venv) at the start of your terminal prompt. If not, reactivate it:

Bash

.\venv\Scripts\activate
Run the Streamlit Application: Execute the main application file (assuming it's named main.py or app.py):

Bash


# streamlit run app.py
Access the App: The command will automatically open a tab in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

Generate Report:

Enter the desired Stock Ticker into the input field.

Click the "Generate Analysis" button.

The CrewAI agents will coordinate, fetch data, analyze it, and the final comprehensive report will be displayed on the screen.
